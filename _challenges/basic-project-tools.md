Become comfortable using various online tools often found in industry workplaces, such as Virtual kan-ban boards, collaborative coding platforms and version control systems.

## Possible Projects
Start a new project or look at one you’ve already started and break it down into smaller chunks, then add these to a virtual kanban board such as Trello. Once you’ve done a little work, add this to a Versions Control System (VCS) such as GitHub.

If you are struggling with starting a new project, then make a Trello page for some of the themes you enjoy, and then see if this helps you visualise ways you could work these into a technical project, such as a website or app.
